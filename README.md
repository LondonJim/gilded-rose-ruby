# The Gilded Rose (in Ruby)

I did this with [Jimmy Sutherland](https://github.com/londonJim). We refactored the extremely nested code.

# How?

We wrote passing tests for all the legacy code, then proceded to refactor and rewrite the code using switch cases, going through each test until they passed.

# How to install

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jdm79/gilded-rose-ruby.git
$ bundle 

```

# How to test

```
$ rspec
```

# Example execution

```
$ ruby texttest_fixture.rb
```
